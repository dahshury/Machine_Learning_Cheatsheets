### Object Tracking Loss Functions

| Loss Function        | Purpose | Formula | Key Points |
|----------------------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Bounding Box Loss (L1 Loss)** | Measures the error in predicted bounding box coordinates | **$\mathcal{L}_{\text{bbox}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left\| \text{bbox}_i - \hat{\text{bbox}}_i \right\|$** <br><br> *where:* <br> $\text{bbox}_i$: True bounding box coordinates <br> $\hat{\text{bbox}}_i$: Predicted bounding box coordinates | - **Pros:** Simple and effective for coordinate regression <br> - **Cons:** May not account for aspect ratio changes |
| **Intersection over Union (IoU) Loss** | Measures the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes | **$\mathcal{L}_{\text{IoU}} = 1 - \frac{\text{Area of Intersection}}{\text{Area of Union}}$** <br><br> *where:* <br> $\text{Area of Intersection}$: Overlapping area of the predicted and ground truth boxes <br> $\text{Area of Union}$: Union area of the predicted and ground truth boxes | - **Pros:** Directly measures the overlap quality <br> - **Cons:** Can be less informative for objects with very small overlap |
| **Center-ness Loss** | Focuses on the center of the bounding box for better localization | **$\mathcal{L}_{\text{center}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left\| \text{center}_i - \hat{\text{center}}_i \right\|$** <br><br> *where:* <br> $\text{center}_i$: True center coordinates <br> $\hat{\text{center}}_i$: Predicted center coordinates | - **Pros:** Improves the accuracy of the bounding box center <br> - **Cons:** Requires accurate detection of bounding box centers |
| **Objectness Loss** | Determines if a region contains an object or not | **$\mathcal{L}_{\text{obj}} = -\left(y \log(p) + (1-y) \log(1-p)\right)$** <br><br> *where:* <br> $y$: True label (object or no object) <br> $p$: Predicted probability of object presence | - **Pros:** Effective for distinguishing between object and background <br> - **Cons:** May not handle class imbalance well |
| **Tracking Loss (e.g., Kalman Filter Loss)** | Estimates the motion of the object over time | **$\mathcal{L}_{\text{tracking}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left\| \text{state}_i - \hat{\text{state}}_i \right\|^2$** <br><br> *where:* <br> $\text{state}_i$: True object state (e.g., position, velocity) <br> $\hat{\text{state}}_i$: Predicted object state | - **Pros:** Captures motion and trajectory of objects <br> - **Cons:** Depends on accurate state estimation and dynamic model |

| **Distance Intersection over Union (DIoU)** | Incorporates distance between the center points of the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes | **$\text{DIoU} = \text{IoU} - \frac{\rho^2(\text{center}_p, \text{center}_g)}{c^2}$** <br><br> *where:* <br> $\rho(\text{center}_p, \text{center}_g)$: Euclidean distance between predicted and ground truth centers <br> $c$: Diagonal length of the smallest enclosing box | - **Pros:** Accounts for center distance to improve localization <br> - **Cons:** More computationally intensive than IoU |
