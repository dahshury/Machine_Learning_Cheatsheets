**Usage Notes:**

- **Mix and Match**: Most augmentation techniques can be combined to create even more diverse datasets.
- **Task-Specific**: Some techniques like `vertical flip`, `elastic deformation`, or `cutout` are more suited to certain domains like medical imaging, text recognition, or object occlusion.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Parameters like the degree of rotation, the amount of zoom, or the noise level can be tuned to best match the dataset needs.
- **Data Augmentation Libraries**: Libraries such as `imgaug`, `Albumentations`, `Keras ImageDataGenerator`, and `torchvision.transforms` provide implementations for most of these techniques.
