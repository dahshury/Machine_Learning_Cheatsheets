| **Harris Corner Detector**    | Identifies corner points by analyzing gradient changes in multiple directions. | Corner detection                            | Object tracking, image matching                           |
| **FAST**                     | Fast corner detection using intensity comparison on a circular pattern.        | Real-time corner detection                  | Feature matching in real-time systems                     |
| **SIFT**                     | Detects keypoints and computes descriptors invariant to scale and rotation.    | Keypoint detection, matching                | Object recognition, image stitching                       |
| **SURF**                     | Similar to SIFT, but faster due to the use of integral images and Haar wavelets. | Faster keypoint detection, matching         | Image recognition, tracking                               |
| **ORB**                      | Combines FAST for keypoint detection and BRIEF for descriptor computation.     | Real-time keypoint matching                 | Augmented reality, 3D reconstruction                      |
| **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** | Detects features by analyzing the direction of intensity gradients.          | Feature detection, object recognition       | Pedestrian detection, object recognition                  |
| **BRIEF**                    | Generates compact binary descriptors for keypoints.                           | Efficient keypoint descriptor generation     | Real-time tracking, image matching                        |
