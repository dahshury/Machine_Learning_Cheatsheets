| **Thresholding**             | Converts the image into binary by applying a threshold.                         | Basic segmentation, object/background separation | Document scanning, OCR, simple object detection           |
| **Watershed Algorithm**      | Treats image intensities like a topographic surface and finds object boundaries. | Complex object separation                 | Medical imaging, marker-based segmentation                |
| **K-means Clustering**       | Groups pixels into clusters based on intensity or color.                        | Color-based segmentation                  | Object tracking, image segmentation in natural scenes      |
| **Region Growing**           | Selects seed points and grows regions by adding neighboring pixels that have similar values. | Accurate region segmentation              | Medical imaging, region-based object detection             |
| **Graph-Cut**                | Segments the image by solving an energy minimization problem on a graph structure. | Accurate segmentation for complex scenes  | Image segmentation in cluttered environments               |
| **GrabCut**                  | Interactive foreground extraction method based on graph-cuts and color models.  | Semi-automated segmentation               | Foreground extraction, photo editing                       |
| **Active Contour (Snakes)**  | Contours evolve iteratively to fit object boundaries based on energy minimization. | Boundary-based object segmentation        | Medical imaging, object boundary detection                 |
| **Deep Learning (UNet, Mask R-CNN)** | Uses neural networks to perform semantic or instance-level segmentation.            | High-level, precise segmentation           | Autonomous driving, scene understanding, medical imaging   |
