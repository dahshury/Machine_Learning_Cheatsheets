| **Global Thresholding**         | Applies a single threshold value to the entire image. Pixels above the threshold are set to max (white), and below are set to min (black). | Simplest form of thresholding, easy to implement.                                                 | Simple binary segmentation, document scanning               |
| **Otsu's Thresholding**         | Automatically calculates an optimal threshold value that minimizes intra-class variance (background vs foreground). | Adaptive to image intensity histograms, works well when the image has two peaks in its histogram.  | Image segmentation, object detection                        |
| **Adaptive Mean Thresholding**  | Computes the threshold for a small region of the image, based on the mean of the neighborhood.   | Handles varying lighting conditions across different parts of the image.                          | Images with non-uniform lighting, scanned documents          |
| **Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding** | Computes the threshold for a small region of the image based on a weighted sum (Gaussian) of nearby pixel values. | Similar to adaptive mean, but uses Gaussian weights to give higher importance to nearby pixels.    | Images with gradients, non-uniform illumination              |
| **Binary Thresholding**         | Converts image to a binary image (black and white) based on a fixed threshold.                  | Simplest thresholding method for separating foreground from background.                           | Basic object detection, image segmentation                   |
| **Binary Inverse Thresholding** | Similar to binary thresholding but inverts the black and white values.                          | Useful when the background is darker than the objects.                                            | Image segmentation, object isolation                        |
| **Truncation Thresholding**     | Pixels above the threshold are set to the threshold value; pixels below remain unchanged.       | Limits the pixel intensity values while retaining some detail below the threshold.                | Image preprocessing, brightness correction                  |
| **Tozero Thresholding**         | Pixels below the threshold are set to zero; above-threshold pixels remain unchanged.            | Keeps object highlights while removing the background.                                            | Segmentation with intensity preservation                    |
| **Tozero Inverse Thresholding** | Pixels above the threshold are set to zero, while pixels below remain unchanged.                | Inverse of `tozero`, often used when background needs to be kept, and bright objects discarded.    | Object detection with background emphasis                   |
| **Multilevel Thresholding**     | Divides an image into multiple regions by selecting multiple threshold values (e.g., low, medium, high). | Useful for segmenting images with more than two distinct object classes.                           | Image classification, medical imaging segmentation          |
| **Niblack Thresholding**        | Computes local threshold for each pixel based on local mean and standard deviation.             | Handles noisy images with varying illumination.                                                   | Document analysis, text extraction                          |
| **Sauvola Thresholding**        | An improvement on Niblack, adjusting for local image contrast.                                  | Better for images with uneven lighting and high noise.                                            | Document binarization, character recognition                 |
| **Phansalkar Thresholding**     | A variant of Sauvola designed for medical imaging.                                              | Robust to noise, well-suited for high-contrast images like microscopy.                            | Medical imaging, microscopy                                 |
| **Ridler-Calvard (Iterative)**  | Iteratively calculates the optimal threshold by splitting the image into two parts, then recalculating mean values. | Adaptive method useful for complex histograms, semi-automated.                                    | Medical imaging, satellite imagery                          |
| **Isodata Thresholding**        | Similar to Ridler-Calvard, but uses iterative clustering of pixel values to find the optimal threshold. | Useful for segmenting complex images without prior knowledge of the pixel intensity distribution.   | Image segmentation, clustering analysis                     |
| **Triangle Thresholding**       | Finds the threshold value by fitting a triangle on the image histogram and selecting the peak of the histogram valley. | Works well when there's a sharp difference between the object and the background.                  | Edge detection, object segmentation in high-contrast images  |
| **Percentile Thresholding**     | Threshold is chosen based on a percentile of the pixel intensity distribution.                 | Enables control over the portion of pixels selected, useful for specific pixel distributions.      | Custom image thresholding, histogram analysis                |
| **Entropy-Based Thresholding**  | Chooses the threshold by maximizing entropy between object and background pixel distributions.  | Useful for maximizing information retained during segmentation.                                   | Information theory-based segmentation, medical images        |
