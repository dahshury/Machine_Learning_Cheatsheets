|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sobel Operator**     | Computes the gradient of the image intensity in both horizontal and vertical directions.               | Detects edges based on the gradient magnitude, commonly used for basic edge detection.           | Object recognition, general image preprocessing             |
| **Prewitt Operator**   | Similar to Sobel, but uses a simpler averaging filter for calculating the gradient.                   | Less sensitive to noise than Sobel but provides similar edge detection results.                  | General edge detection, basic segmentation                  |
| **Roberts Cross Operator** | Calculates the gradient of the image using diagonal differences.                                    | Detects sharp edges in both horizontal and vertical directions, particularly in high-frequency areas. | Medical imaging, microscopy                                 |
| **Scharr Operator**    | A more accurate version of the Sobel operator with better rotational symmetry.                        | Provides higher accuracy in edge detection compared to Sobel, especially for diagonal edges.      | High-precision edge detection, object tracking              |
| **Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)** | Applies a Gaussian filter to smooth the image, followed by the Laplacian operator to detect edges based on the second derivative. | Detects edges and suppresses noise by smoothing the image first.                                  | Texture detection, image enhancement                        |
| **Canny Edge Detection** | A multi-step algorithm that includes noise reduction, gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, and edge tracking by hysteresis. | Produces thin and accurate edges with noise reduction, the most popular edge detection method.     | Object tracking, shape detection, face detection            |
| **Difference of Gaussians (DoG)** | Subtracts two blurred images (with different sigma values) to detect edges.                    | Simplified approximation of the Laplacian of Gaussian, with computational efficiency.             | Blob detection, object boundary detection                   |
| **Zero-Crossing Detection** | Detects edges where the second derivative of the image intensity function crosses zero.              | Provides precise edge location detection for edges characterized by abrupt intensity changes.      | Medical imaging, astronomy                                  |
| **Kirsch Operator**    | Uses a compass mask to calculate the gradient in eight possible directions.                           | Detects edges in multiple directions, suitable for highly directional edge detection.             | Edge detection in noisy or low-resolution images            |
| **Robinson Compass Mask** | Uses compass-style gradient operators in four directions (North, East, South, West).                  | Detects edges in specific directions, similar to Kirsch but with simpler calculations.            | Edge detection with directional emphasis                    |
| **Frei-Chen Operator** | A set of nine convolution masks (including Sobel-like and other masks) designed for accurate edge and texture detection. | Produces more accurate edges than Sobel by using a combination of gradient and texture operators. | Advanced texture and edge detection, image preprocessing    |
| **Gabor Filter**       | A linear filter that detects edges by responding to specific frequencies and orientations in the image. | Ideal for detecting edges along specific directions and frequencies.                             | Texture analysis, pattern recognition, fingerprint recognition |
| **Phase Congruency**   | Detects edges based on phase information in the frequency domain rather than intensity gradients.       | Provides robust edge detection insensitive to lighting variations or contrast changes.            | Object recognition, image matching                          |
| **Structured Forests** | A machine-learning based method that learns structured edges from image patches using random forests.  | Learns edge structures from data, providing high-level, complex edge detection.                  | Semantic segmentation, object detection                     |
| **Holistically-Nested Edge Detection (HED)** | A deep learning-based approach that detects edges at multiple image scales using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). | Produces highly accurate and semantically meaningful edges.                                      | Scene understanding, deep-learning-based image segmentation |
