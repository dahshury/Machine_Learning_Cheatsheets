### Upsampling Techniques

| **Technique**           | **Purpose**                                                  | **How It Works**                                                                                   | **Key Points**                                                    |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Nearest Neighbor**     | Simple upsampling method that replicates the nearest pixel   | The nearest pixel value to the target pixel is assigned. No new pixel information is generated.     | Fast but produces blocky artifacts; useful for real-time tasks. |
| **Bilinear Interpolation** | Smooth interpolation using a weighted average of 2x2 neighboring pixels | Takes the weighted average of the four nearest pixel values based on distance to the new pixel.      | Smoother than nearest neighbor; balances speed and quality. |
| **Bicubic Interpolation** | Uses weighted average of 4x4 neighboring pixels             | Interpolates pixel values using the weighted average of the 16 closest neighbors.                   | Produces smoother results than bilinear, but slower. Ideal for high-quality upscaling. |
| **Transpose Convolution (ConvTranspose2d)** | Learns to upsample through transposed convolution                | Applies learned kernels, reversing the effect of convolution, to expand spatial resolution.         | Produces learned upsampling results; used in GANs and autoencoders. |
| **Pixel Shuffle**        | Rearranges elements to upscale image                         | Rearranges the pixels of a lower resolution image into a higher resolution. Typically used after convolution. | Efficient and used in tasks like super-resolution. |
| **Nearest Neighbor + Convolution** | Combines nearest neighbor with convolution for learned upsampling | Upsamples using nearest neighbor, then applies a convolution to refine features.                    | Combines speed of nearest neighbor with learnable convolutional refinement. |
| **Upsample (PyTorch)**   | General upsampling layer with different modes                | Can perform nearest, bilinear, or bicubic upsampling depending on the mode selected.                 | Simple and flexible; supports different interpolation modes. |

### Downsampling Techniques

| **Technique**            | **Purpose**                                                  | **How It Works**                                                                                   | **Key Points**                                                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Max Pooling (MaxPool2d)** | Downsamples by taking the maximum value in each pooling window | Divides the input into non-overlapping or overlapping regions and takes the maximum value of each.   | Highlights important features, reduces spatial size and overfitting. |
| **Average Pooling (AvgPool2d)** | Downsamples by averaging the values in each pooling window | Takes the average of the values in each region (window) of the input to reduce spatial dimensions.    | Smoother downsampling, preserves global features better than Max Pooling. |
| **Strided Convolution**   | Learns to downsample using convolution with strides > 1      | Applies convolution with a larger stride (step size) to reduce spatial dimensions.                   | Reduces dimensionality while learning features; no pooling required. |
| **Gaussian Pyramid**      | Multi-scale downsampling through Gaussian filtering and subsampling | Applies a Gaussian filter to smooth the image, then reduces spatial dimensions by subsampling.        | Often used in multi-scale feature extraction (e.g., image pyramids). |
| **Laplacian Pyramid**     | Downsampling by subtracting Gaussian pyramid layers          | Computes the difference between successive Gaussian levels to capture fine details.                  | Used in image compression and reconstruction. |
| **Resize with Interpolation** | Reduces image size using interpolation methods (bilinear, bicubic) | Resizes the image by interpolating between pixel values using bilinear or bicubic methods.            | Simple and flexible downsampling, not learnable. |
| **Adaptive Pooling (AdaptiveAvgPool2d / AdaptiveMaxPool2d)** | Downsamples to a specific output size regardless of input size | Divides the input into adaptable regions to produce a fixed-size output, averaging or taking max within each region. | Output size is fixed; useful when working with varying input sizes. |
