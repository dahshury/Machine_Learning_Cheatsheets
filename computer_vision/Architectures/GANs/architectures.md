| **WGAN**         | Solve instability issues in GAN training               | Uses Wasserstein distance (Earth Moverâ€™s Distance), weight clipping, no sigmoid activation in the discriminator     | Wasserstein loss                         | Stable GAN training, high-quality image generation, reduces mode collapse                                      |
| **WGAN-GP**      | Improved WGAN (gradient penalty)                      | Replaces weight clipping with gradient penalty, which improves stability and convergence                           | Wasserstein loss + Gradient Penalty       | More stable training for GANs, reducing gradient vanishing/explosion                                           |
| **SRGAN**        | Super-resolution image generation                     | Uses perceptual loss (combining MSE with feature maps from pre-trained CNNs like VGG)                              | Perceptual loss (MSE + VGG loss)          | Image super-resolution, enhancing low-resolution images for tasks like medical imaging, satellite imaging       |
| **PSNR**         | Metric to measure image reconstruction quality        | Measures the peak signal-to-noise ratio between two images (higher is better)                                      | -                                         | Used to evaluate GANs in image reconstruction and super-resolution tasks                                       |
| **SSIM**         | Metric to assess structural similarity of images       | Measures similarity in structural information between two images (ranges from 0 to 1)                              | -                                         | Evaluating visual quality in super-resolution and image restoration                                            |
| **Wasserstein Distance** | Metric for comparing distributions                | Measures how much "mass" must be moved to transform one distribution into another (used in WGAN)                    | -                                         | Applied in WGAN to make training more stable and meaningful                                                     |
| **DragGAN**      | Interactive image manipulation                        | Allows users to drag points on an image and manipulate the output based on user-defined constraints                 | Varies (depends on application)           | Interactive photo editing, facial expression manipulation, fine-tuned control over image generation             |
